      <h2>About Vanilla Cake</h2>
      <p>
        The classic vanilla cake has a rich and fascinating history that
        stretches back several centuries. Early versions of sponge-like cakes
        emerged in Europe in the 17th century, when refined sugar became more
        widely available. The French and British were among the first to perfect
        airy cake recipes, often flavored with exotic ingredients like vanilla,
        which at the time was a luxury imported from Mexico and Madagascar.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the 19th century, technological advances such as the invention of
        baking powder and improved ovens allowed home bakers to produce lighter,
        fluffier cakes with greater consistency. Vanilla cake quickly gained
        popularity as a versatile dessert, simple enough for everyday enjoyment,
        yet elegant enough for weddings, birthdays, and high-society gatherings.
      </p>
      <p>
        In modern times, the vanilla cake has evolved into countless variations,
        from multi-layered masterpieces with intricate frosting designs to
        rustic single-layer bakes topped with fresh fruit. Today, it remains a
        universal favorite, beloved for its soft crumb, subtle sweetness, and
        ability to pair harmoniously with almost any filling or topping. Whether
        baked from scratch or using a mix, the classic vanilla cake continues to
        be a symbol of comfort, celebration, and timeless flavor.

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line two 9-inch round
          cake pans with parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt
          until evenly mixed.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar together with a
          hand mixer or stand mixer until pale and fluffy (about 3 minutes).
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in
          the vanilla extract.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the dry ingredients in three
          additions, alternating with milk. Start and end with dry ingredients.
          Mix until just combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Divide the batter evenly between the pans and smooth the tops with a
          spatula.
        </li>
        <li>
          <mark
            >Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the
            center comes out clean.</mark
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire
          rack to cool completely before frosting.
        </li>

      <h2><mark>Tips</mark></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For an extra moist cake, replace half of the milk with buttermilk.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure all ingredients are at room temperature for best results.
        </li>
        <li>Do not overmix the batter — it can make the cake dense.</li>
        <li>
          You can make cupcakes with the same batter; just bake for 18–20
          minutes.
